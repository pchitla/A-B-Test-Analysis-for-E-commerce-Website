# A-B-Test-Analysis-for-E-commerce-Website

For this project, I worked to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. Some descriptive and inferential statistics were applied to the data set to drive conclusions from the data set. In the end, a linear regression model was built to help understand what drives conversions.
